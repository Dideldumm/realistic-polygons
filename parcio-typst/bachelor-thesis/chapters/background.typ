= Realistic Polygons

Realistic Polygons are Polygons that you would can imagine to find in some form in our world.
Most people may think about some regular shapes like the *Waben* of a beehive. Such simplistic forms are realistic polygons, but the shape can be much more complex. An example of a more complex polygon that we find in our world would be the skylines shape of a city or a countrie's boarder.It can also be in the form of a leaf or the shadow of an object. Frankly speaking, it is hard for a someone that never heard of realistic polygons to think of a polygon that is not realistic. A polygon is not realistic if you cannot imagine finding it in th real world. That usually happens if the polygon is either too regular or too irregular.
