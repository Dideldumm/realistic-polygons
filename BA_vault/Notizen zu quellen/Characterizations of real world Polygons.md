## Basic Terms
- **Simple Polygon**
	- a Polygon is simple if its edges only intersect at their end points
- **Visibility**
	- Point *p* sees point *q* if the line section $\overline{pq}$ is completely inside a Polygon *P*
- **Convex and reflex vertices**
	- A vertex *v* is convex if its internal angle is less than 180° otherwise *v* is reflex
- **Convex Chains**
	- A path of points $p_1, ..., p_n$ is a convex chain, if for every edge of the chain the adjacent edges lie on the same side
- Diameter
	- The diameter of a set of points is the maximum distance between two points of the set
- Fatness
